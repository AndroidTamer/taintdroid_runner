This directory contains a prototype called TaintDroid Runner.

Goal of the TaintDroid Runner is to automatically run Android applications in an
emulated TaintDroid 2.3 environment and analyze their behavior.
To use the TaintDroid Runner you also need the modified TaintDroid 2.3 sources. How 
to get and build them can be found on 
https://sites.google.com/site/taintdroid23/.

The TaintDroidRunner is written in Python and comes with its main file 
taintdroid_runner.py and a bunch of helper files.
